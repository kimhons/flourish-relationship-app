## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Complex Filtering System
**Challenge**: Creating an intuitive yet powerful filtering system for destination discovery.

**Solution**: Implemented a combined approach using a searchable input field with real-time filtering alongside dropdown selectors for price range and destination type. This provides both precision and ease of use while maintaining a clean interface.

### Challenge 2: Activity Selection Management
**Challenge**: Designing an intuitive system for selecting and managing multiple activities across categories.

**Solution**: Created a toggle-based selection system with visual feedback and a consolidated summary view. This allows users to easily see their selections while browsing additional options, with simple addition and removal capabilities.

**Challenge**: Implementing a date selection system that handles availability, duration calculation, and seasonal recommendations.

**Solution**: Integrated a range-based calendar component with custom styling and feedback. The system calculates duration automatically and provides toast notifications for confirmation, with future capability to integrate with destination availability data.

### Challenge 4: Progress Tracking
**Challenge**: Creating an intuitive progress tracking system that accurately reflects planning completion.

**Solution**: Implemented a weighted progress calculation based on the importance of each planning component (destination selection, activity selection, date planning). This provides users with meaningful feedback on their planning progress.
