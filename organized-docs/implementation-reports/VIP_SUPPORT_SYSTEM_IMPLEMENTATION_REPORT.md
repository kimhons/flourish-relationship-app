## 3. Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 3.1 Real-Time Communication

**Challenge:** Implementing a responsive, real-time messaging system for support interactions.

**Solution:** Implemented a message thread component with optimistic UI updates and real-time status indicators. The system shows message delivery and read status, with appropriate loading states during transmission. The architecture supports both immediate display of user messages and real-time updates when specialist responses are received.

### 3.2 Multi-Channel Support

**Challenge:** Creating a unified interface that supports different communication channels (chat, phone, video) while maintaining a consistent user experience.

**Solution:** Developed a channel-agnostic support architecture with specialized UI components for each communication method. The system maintains context across channels, allowing conversations to seamlessly transition between text, voice, and video while preserving history and context.

### 3.3 Support Specialist Assignment

**Challenge:** Designing a system that connects users with appropriate specialists based on topic, urgency, and history.

**Solution:** Created a specialist matching system that considers multiple factors:

- Specialist expertise and availability
- Previous interactions between user and specialists
- Current support queue and workload

This approach ensures optimal matching while maintaining reasonable response times.

### 3.4 Status Tracking and Transparency

**Challenge:** Providing clear visibility into support request status and expected resolution timelines.

**Solution:** Implemented a comprehensive status tracking system with:
- Visual status indicators with clear color coding
- Estimated response and resolution times
- Real-time updates on specialist actions
- Notification system for status changes
- Historical metrics for similar issues

This transparency builds user confidence and reduces anxiety during support interactions.
