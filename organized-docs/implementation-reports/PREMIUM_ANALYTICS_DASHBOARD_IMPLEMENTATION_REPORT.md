## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Performance Optimization

**Challenge**: Initial implementation of multiple charts caused performance issues, especially on mobile devices.

**Solution**: Implemented lazy loading for chart components, rendering only visible tabs. Added memoization for chart data processing and implemented virtualization for large datasets.

### Challenge 2: Data Visualization Consistency

**Challenge**: Maintaining consistent visual styling across different chart types and ensuring accessibility.

**Solution**: Created a centralized chart theme configuration system that applies consistent colors, fonts, and styling across all visualizations. Implemented accessible color schemes with sufficient contrast and added text alternatives for screen readers.

### Challenge 3: Responsive Layout

**Challenge**: Creating a dashboard that works effectively across device sizes without compromising functionality.

**Solution**: Implemented a flexible grid system with breakpoints for different device sizes. Developed alternative visualizations for smaller screens and created collapsible sections to preserve access to all data.

### Challenge 4: Real-time Updates

**Challenge**: Ensuring dashboard data remains current without excessive API calls.

**Solution**: Implemented an efficient data caching system with selective refresh strategies. Used WebSockets for real-time updates to critical metrics and developed a background synchronization system for offline support.
