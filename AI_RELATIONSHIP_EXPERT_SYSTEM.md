### 3. Security Against Prompt Injection

#### Multi-Layer Protection
1. **Input Validation**
   - Pattern matching against 40+ injection patterns
   - Suspicious keyword detection
   - Special character ratio limits
   - Encoded content detection
   - Length restrictions

2. **Output Validation**
   - System prompt leak detection
   - Code execution prevention
   - Excessive repetition detection
   - Response sanitization

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - 30 requests per minute
   - 500 requests per hour
   - 5000 requests per day
   - Automatic IP blocking for violations

4. **Security Audit Trail**
   - All security events logged
   - Injection attempts tracked
   - IP-based suspicious activity monitoring
   - Automatic blocking for repeat offenders

#### Injection Patterns Detected
- Instruction override attempts ("ignore previous instructions")
- System prompt extraction ("show me your prompt")
- Code injection (JavaScript, Python, SQL)
- Command injection (shell commands)
- Jailbreak attempts (DAN mode, developer mode)
- Prompt manipulation ("repeat after me")

- Emotional state tracking
- Session duration and engagement metrics

#### Evidence-Based Guidance
- Grounded in relationship science and psychology
- Practical, actionable advice
- Cultural sensitivity
- Professional boundary maintenance

#### Safety Features
- Crisis detection and intervention
- Resource provision for emergencies
- Professional help encouragement
- 24/7 crisis hotline information

@validate_ai_response     # Output validation
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Relationship Query
```python
# User asks about communication issues
prompt, metadata = relationship_expert.create_secure_prompt(
    "My partner and I keep having the same arguments",
    RelationshipExpertise.COMMUNICATION_SKILLS,
    context={"relationship_status": "married", "duration": "5 years"}
)
```

### Crisis Intervention
```python
# System detects crisis keywords
if crisis_level >= 7:
    expertise = RelationshipExpertise.CONFLICT_RESOLUTION
    template = PromptTemplate.CRISIS_INTERVENTION
    # Immediate safety resources provided
```

### Multi-Expert Consultation
```python
# Complex trust issues trigger multiple experts
enable_multi_expert = expertise in [
    RelationshipExpertise.TRUST_BUILDING,
    RelationshipExpertise.CRISIS_INTERVENTION
]
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never Trust User Input**: All prompts validated before processing
2. **Output Filtering**: AI responses checked for leaks
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
4. **Audit Trail**: All security events logged for analysis
5. **Fail Secure**: Safe fallback responses when filtering needed
6. **Regular Updates**: Injection patterns updated regularly
