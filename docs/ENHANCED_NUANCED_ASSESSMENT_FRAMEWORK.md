    # Identify personality dimensions needing deeper exploration
    exploration_needs = identify_exploration_priorities(personality_profile)
    
    # Select question that maximizes information gain
    next_question = optimize_information_gain(
        available_questions=get_domain_questions(current_domain),
        response_patterns=response_patterns,
        exploration_needs=exploration_needs,
