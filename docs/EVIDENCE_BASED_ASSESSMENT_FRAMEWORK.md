# Flourish App: Evidence-Based Assessment Framework

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the scientifically-validated assessment framework for the Flourish relationship platform, based on extensive psychological research and validated instruments. The framework integrates three core assessment domains to provide comprehensive relationship compatibility analysis.

## Scientific Foundation

### Research Base
- **9-year longitudinal study** (N=972 couples) showing Big Five personality traits predict long-term relationship satisfaction
- **Meta-analytic evidence** from 43 datasets with 11,000+ couples using machine learning for relationship prediction
- **Validated attachment theory instruments** with established psychometric properties
- **Cross-cultural validation** across multiple populations and relationship types

### Key Research Findings

#### Big Five Personality Traits & Relationships
**Actor Effects (Own Personality Impact):**
- **Neuroticism**: Strong negative predictor (ρ = -0.29, p < .05) - most important factor
- **Conscientiousness**: Strong positive predictor (ρ = 0.25, p < .05) - second most important
- **Agreeableness**: Moderate positive predictor (ρ = 0.29, p < .05)
- **Extraversion**: Small positive predictor (ρ = 0.17, p < .05) - gender differences noted
- **Openness**: Weak positive predictor (ρ = 0.10, p < .05)

**Partner Effects (Partner's Personality Impact):**
- Generally smaller than actor effects but still significant
- Neuroticism: Negative impact (r = -0.22, p < .05)
- Conscientiousness: Positive impact (r = 0.12, p < .05)
- Agreeableness: Positive impact (r = 0.15, p < .05)

**Longitudinal vs Cross-Sectional Differences:**
- Actor effects more predictive than partner effects in long-term relationships
- Some traits (Extraversion, Agreeableness) show different patterns over time
- Neuroticism and Conscientiousness remain consistently predictive

#### Attachment Theory & Relationships
**Validated Attachment Styles:**
- **Secure**: 60% of population, highest relationship satisfaction
- **Anxious**: 20% of population, seeks closeness but fears abandonment
- **Avoidant**: 15% of population, values independence over intimacy
- **Disorganized**: 5% of population, inconsistent attachment patterns

**Relationship Outcomes:**
- Secure attachment predicts higher relationship satisfaction and longevity
- Anxious attachment associated with relationship anxiety and jealousy
- Avoidant attachment linked to emotional distance and commitment issues
- Attachment styles can be modified through awareness and intervention

    """
    Calculate Big Five trait scores with normative comparison
    """
    raw_scores = {
        'openness': sum(openness_items) / len(openness_items),
        'conscientiousness': sum(conscientiousness_items) / len(conscientiousness_items),
        'extraversion': sum(extraversion_items) / len(extraversion_items),
        'agreeableness': sum(agreeableness_items) / len(agreeableness_items),
        'neuroticism': sum(neuroticism_items) / len(neuroticism_items)
    }
    
    # Convert to percentile scores using normative data
    percentile_scores = convert_to_percentiles(raw_scores)
    
    return {
        'raw_scores': raw_scores,
        'percentile_scores': percentile_scores,
        'trait_descriptions': generate_trait_descriptions(percentile_scores),
        'relationship_implications': generate_relationship_insights(percentile_scores)
    }
```

#### Attachment Style Classification
```python
def classify_attachment_style(closeness, dependence, anxiety):
    """
    Classify attachment style based on three dimensions
    """
    # Standardize scores
    closeness_z = (closeness - closeness_mean) / closeness_sd
    dependence_z = (dependence - dependence_mean) / dependence_sd
    anxiety_z = (anxiety - anxiety_mean) / anxiety_sd
    
    # Classification logic
    if closeness_z > 0 and dependence_z > 0 and anxiety_z < 0:
        return 'secure'
    elif closeness_z > 0 and dependence_z > 0 and anxiety_z > 0:
        return 'anxious_preoccupied'
    elif closeness_z < 0 and dependence_z < 0 and anxiety_z < 0:
        return 'dismissive_avoidant'
    else:
        return 'fearful_avoidant'
```

### Quality Assurance

#### Response Validation
