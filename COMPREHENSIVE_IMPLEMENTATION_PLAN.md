**Author:** Manus AI  
**Date:** January 7, 2025  
**Version:** 2.0 - Combined Implementation Strategy  
**Project:** Complete implementation of Flourish relationship platform

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document provides a systematic implementation plan for completing all 290+ remaining screens of the Flourish relationship platform using a combined approach that integrates feature development with screen implementation. The current implementation includes approximately 25-30 screens, leaving 290+ screens to be built according to the comprehensive blueprint.

The implementation follows a phase-based approach with integrated checkpoints, ensuring that each screen is built within the context of complete feature systems rather than in isolation. This approach ensures better integration, consistency, and overall platform coherence.
