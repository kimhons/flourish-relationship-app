- **Presentation Components**: Handle UI rendering and user interactions
- **Container Components**: Manage state and data flow
- **Context Providers**: Share state across related components
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulate reusable logic and state management
- **Utility Functions**: Handle common operations and data transformations

### State Management

State is managed using a combination of approaches:

- **Local Component State**: For UI-specific state using useState
