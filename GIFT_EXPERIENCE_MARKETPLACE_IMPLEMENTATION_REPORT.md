## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Relationship Context Integration
**Challenge**: Differentiating from generic e-commerce by meaningfully connecting products to relationship benefits.

### Challenge 2: Product Data Structure
**Challenge**: Creating a flexible data model that accommodates both physical gifts and bookable experiences.

**Solution**: Developed a hybrid data structure with shared attributes (pricing, ratings) and type-specific fields (delivery for gifts, location/duration for experiences), with a unified cart system that handles both types.

### Challenge 3: User Experience Complexity
**Challenge**: Balancing comprehensive information with a clean, intuitive interface.

**Solution**: Implemented a tab-based navigation system with progressive disclosure of information, using cards for browsing and detailed modals for comprehensive product information, maintaining visual clarity while providing depth when needed.

### Challenge 4: Cart Management
**Challenge**: Creating a unified cart system that handles different product types with appropriate options.

**Solution**: Developed a flexible cart data structure that tracks product type alongside standard cart information, with type-specific rendering and options in the cart interface.
